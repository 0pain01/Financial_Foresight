# Security Fixes for User Data Isolation

## Overview
This document outlines the critical security fixes implemented to ensure that each user can only access, modify, and delete their own data in the FinTrack application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing User Validation in CRUD Operations
**Problem**: Users could potentially modify or delete other users' data due to missing user ownership validation.

**Files Fixed**:
- `TransactionController.java`
- `BillController.java`
- `InvestmentController.java`
- `BudgetController.java`
- `IncomeController.java`

**Solution**: Added proper user validation in all update and delete operations:
```java
// Before: No user validation
@PutMapping("/transactions/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<Transaction> updateTransaction(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Transaction transaction) {
    // Could modify any transaction
}

// After: Proper user validation
@PutMapping("/transactions/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<Transaction> updateTransaction(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Transaction transaction, @RequestHeader("Authorization") String authHeader) {
    Long userId = userUtil.getCurrentUserId(authHeader);
    if (userId == null) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED).build();
    }
    
    return transactionRepository.findById(id)
            .map(existingTransaction -> {
                // Ensure the transaction belongs to the current user
                if (!existingTransaction.getUserId().equals(userId)) {
                    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN).build();
                }
                // ... rest of update logic
            });
}
```

### 2. Hardcoded User IDs in Analytics
**Problem**: Dashboard and insights endpoints were hardcoded to use `userId = 1L`, causing all users to see the same data.

**Files Fixed**:
- `DashboardController.java`
- `InsightsController.java`

**Solution**: Added proper authentication and user-specific data retrieval:
```java
// Before: Hardcoded user ID
@GetMapping("/dashboard")
public ResponseEntity<?> dashboard() {
    long userId = 1L; // demo - ALL USERS SEE SAME DATA!
    // ... data retrieval
}

// After: Proper user authentication
@GetMapping("/dashboard")
public ResponseEntity<?> dashboard(@RequestHeader("Authorization") String authHeader) {
    Long userId = userUtil.getCurrentUserId(authHeader);
    if (userId == null) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED).build();
    }
    // ... user-specific data retrieval
}
```

### 3. Database Configuration
**Problem**: Database schema was recreated on every application restart, potentially causing data loss.

**File Fixed**: `application.yml`

**Solution**: Changed from `ddl-auto: create-drop` to `ddl-auto: update` to preserve data between restarts.

### 4. Frontend Error Handling
**Problem**: Generic error messages didn't provide clear feedback for authentication and authorization issues.

**Files Fixed**:
- `queryClient.ts`
- `AuthContext.tsx`

**Solution**: Added specific error handling for HTTP status codes:
- 401: "Authentication failed. Please log in again."
- 403: "Access denied. You don't have permission to perform this action."
- 404: "Resource not found."
- 500: "Server error. Please try again later."

## Security Improvements

### User Data Isolation
✅ **Transactions**: Users can only see, modify, and delete their own transactions
✅ **Bills**: Users can only see, modify, and delete their own bills  
✅ **Investments**: Users can only see, modify, and delete their own investments
✅ **Budgets**: Users can only see, modify, and delete their own budgets
✅ **Income**: Users can only see, modify, and delete their own income records
✅ **Dashboard**: Shows only user-specific data and calculations
✅ **Insights**: Provides user-specific financial insights and projections
✅ **CSV Import**: Imported data is automatically associated with the authenticated user

### Authentication & Authorization
✅ **JWT Validation**: All protected endpoints validate JWT tokens
✅ **User Ownership**: All data operations verify user ownership
✅ **Proper HTTP Status Codes**: 
  - 401 Unauthorized for invalid/missing tokens
  - 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access attempts
  - 404 Not Found for non-existent resources

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
./start.sh

# Frontend (in another terminal)
cd client
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test User Isolation
1. Register two different users (User A and User B)
2. Login as User A and create some data (transactions, bills, investments)
3. Login as User B and create different data
4. Verify each user only sees their own data
5. Try to access/modify other user's data (should get 403 Forbidden)

### 3. Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Test with curl (replace TOKEN_A and TOKEN_B with actual JWT tokens)
# User A's data
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN_A" http://localhost:8080/api/transactions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN_A" http://localhost:8080/api/bills
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN_A" http://localhost:8080/api/investments

# User B's data  
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN_B" http://localhost:8080/api/transactions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN_B" http://localhost:8080/api/bills
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN_B" http://localhost:8080/api/investments
```

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ What Should Work:
- Users can register and login successfully
- Users can create, read, update, and delete their own data
- Dashboard shows user-specific financial summaries
- CSV imports are user-specific
- All data operations respect user boundaries

### ❌ What Should NOT Work:
- Users cannot see other users' data
- Users cannot modify other users' data
- Users cannot delete other users' data
- Unauthenticated requests are rejected (401)
- Unauthorized access attempts are rejected (403)

## Files Modified

### Backend Controllers:
- `TransactionController.java` - Added user validation for update/delete
- `BillController.java` - Added user validation for update/delete  
- `InvestmentController.java` - Added user validation for update/delete
- `BudgetController.java` - Added user validation for update/delete
- `IncomeController.java` - Added user validation for update/delete
- `DashboardController.java` - Fixed hardcoded user ID
- `InsightsController.java` - Fixed hardcoded user ID

### Configuration:
- `application.yml` - Changed database ddl-auto to update

### Frontend:
- `queryClient.ts` - Improved error handling
- `AuthContext.tsx` - Better token validation

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access their own data
2. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
3. **Authentication**: JWT tokens are validated on every request
4. **Authorization**: User ownership is verified before any data operation
5. **Error Handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages
6. **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS settings for security
7. **Session Management**: Stateless JWT-based authentication

## Monitoring & Logging

The application now includes comprehensive logging for security events:
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Authorization failures (403 errors)
- Data access patterns
- User operation logs

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing these additional security features:
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Audit logging for all data modifications
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Password complexity requirements
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Data encryption at rest
- API versioning for backward compatibility

## Support

If you encounter any issues with the security fixes:
1. Check the application logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify that the database is running and accessible
3. Ensure JWT tokens are properly generated and stored
4. Test with the provided test plan above
